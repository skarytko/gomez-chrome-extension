GPN & APM Portal Chrome Extension
================

Chrome extension for managing user logins for Gomez (GPN) and APM portals.

## Features

*	One-click access to the GPN saving the hassle of having to remember and type in often-used usenames/passwords.
* Quick and frustration-free switching between user accounts.  No more session conflicts when logging in or switching accounts.
* Now supports logout of both GPN Portal and APM Portal sessions prior to login.
* Simple import/export feature so you can copy your bookmarked logins across multiple computers (or if you blow-up your computer).
* Auto-update now supported.  If you click “Update extensions now” in the Extensions page the plugin will be updated without having to re-install (that is if I ever get around to making updates…).
